# Release 0.9 Beta (September 25, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release contains several changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot versions. The MacOS hosting view has been renamed and many deprecated properties and methods have been removed. The axis constraints system has been changed; the new class-based system is easier to set up and less prone to problems than the old struct-based system. This release also adds support for many new features including hi-dpi displays on MacOS, @2x images on both iOS and MacOS, shadows on many plot elements, arrows and other line caps on axis lines, and animation support for many plot properties.

## Details

- **New**: Added support for hi-dpi displays in MacOS 10.7 Lion.
- **New**: Added support for @2x images on hi-dpi displays.
- **New**: Added support for shadows.
- **New**: Added arrows and other line caps for axis lines.
- **New**: Added animation support for many plot properties.
- **New**: Added a `shape` property setter to `CPTMutableNumericData`.
- **New**: Implemented the `<NSCoding>` protocol in all Core Plot classes.
- **New**: Added several new plots to the Plot Gallery example application.
- **New**: Added some unit tests.
- **Changed**: Renamed the MacOS hosting view to `CPTGraphHostingView` to match the iOS nomenclature.
- **Changed**: Renamed the `CPTBarPlot` `barLengths` property to `barTips` to conform with the field naming convention (location, tip, and base).
- **Changed**: Changed the axis constraints mechanism--it now uses a class instead of a struct.
- **Changed**: Made plot point pixel alignment optional.
- **Changed**: Made the header files for several internal classes private.
- **Changed**: Performance enhancements in several plots and `CPTXYAxis`.

# Release 0.4 Alpha (July 7, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release contains several changes that will break apps built against earlier Core Plot versions. The class prefix for all Core Plot classes and public symbols changed from "CP" to "CPT". Also, the iOS SDK is no longer supported. iOS projects that were built against the SDK must be updated to include the Core Plot project file or link against the new universal static library instead. 

## Details

- **New**: Added iOS universal static library build target.
- **New**: Added graph legends.
- **New**: Implemented logarithmic plot scales.
- **New**: Added support for multi-line text in `CPTTextLayer`.
- **New**: Added a text alignment property to `CPTTextStyle`.
- **New**: Added a title rotation property to `CPTAxis`.
- **New**: Added several new plots to the Plot Gallery example application.
- **New**: Added an equal interval axis labeling policy.
- **Changed**: Changed the class prefix from "CP" to "CPT" to prevent conflicts with Apple's Core PDF framework.
- **Changed**: Updates to suppress compiler warnings when using the LLVM compiler.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.
- **Removed**: Removed the iOS SDK build and installer packaging scripts.



# Release 0.3 Alpha (May 4, 2011)

## Release Notes

This release adds a new plot type (range plots) and adds features to several other plot types. `CPTextStyle` and `CPLineStyle` have been split into mutable and immutable variants similar to Cocoa's string, data, and collection classes. This change will break existing code that changes text style and line style properties; that code should be updated to use the mutable versions.

## Details

- **New**: Added an option in `CPBarPlot` to set bar widths in data or view coordinates.
- **New**: Added the `allowPinchScaling` property to `CPGraphHostingView`.
- **New**: Added a shared cache of common values to the `NSDecimal` conversion utility functions for performance.
- **New**: Added support for variable bar plot base values, useful for making stacked plots.
- **New**: Added range plot type.
- **New**: Added minor axis tick labels.
- **New**: Added pie chart overlay fill.
- **New**: Added some unit tests.
- **Changed**: Split `CPTextStyle` and `CPLineStyle` into mutable and immutable variants.
- **Changed**: Updated all projects to support Xcode 4.
- **Changed**: Drawing performance improvements in `CPBarPlot`.
- **Changed**: Updated Doxygen configuration files and comments for Doxygen 1.7.3.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.



# Release 0.2.2 Alpha (November 10, 2010)

## Release Notes

This is a maintenance release that corrects some packaging errors in release 0.2.1. It also adds support for missing data in all plot types.

## Details

- **New**: Added support for missing plot data points.
- **New**: Added histogram interpolation to `CPScatterPlot`.
- **New**: Added secondary scatter plot fill.
- **Changed**: Updated the release packaging scripts.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.



# Release 0.2.1 Alpha (October 20, 2010)

## Release Notes

This release adds methods to improve plot performance by only updating the parts of the data cache that changed. It also adds support for Xcode 3.2.4 and the iOS 4.1 SDK.

## Details

- **New**: Added packaging scripts for releases.
- **New**: Added plot methods to add, remove, and reload plot data records without reloading all of the data.
- **New**: Added support for axis label alignment.
- **Changed**: Updated all projects to support Xcode 3.2.4 and the iOS 4.1 SDK.
- **Changed**: Optimized plot symbol drawing.
- **Changed**: Miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanup.
- **Removed**: Removed the Core Plot animation classes.



# Release 0.2 Alpha (September 10, 2010)

## Release Notes

This release adds data labels to all plots and adds features to scatter plots and pie charts. It also makes substantial improvements to `CPNumericData` and modifies the plots to use it for the internal data cache. All C++ code has been removed from Core Plot, which improves performance and simplifies the process of linking Core Plot into other projects.

## Details

- **New**: Added plot data labels.
- **New**: Added stepped interpolation to `CPScatterPlot`.
- **New**: Added `NSDecimal` support to `CPNumericData`.
- **New**: Added `NSDecimal` utility functions for all primitive types supported by `NSNumber`.
- **New**: Added slice selection delegate method to `CPPieChart`.
- **New**: Added some unit tests.
